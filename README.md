# Predictors of Height in Romanian Infants 6-23 Months Old: Findings from a National Representative Sample

Background. The research explored the association between infants’ height and various 
demographic factors in Romania, a country where such critical information has been lacking. 

Methods. This study was conducted on a nationally representative sample and used a family 
physicians database to determine a sample of 1,532 children (713 girls and 819 boys) 6 to 23 
months of age (M = 14.26; SD = 5.15). Infants’ height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) were calculated 
using the World Health Organization’s computing algorithm. A multiple regression analysis was 
conducted to investigate whether certain risk factors, such as infant mother’s age, location, 
marital status, socioeconomic status (SES), as well as infant's term status at birth, age, anemia, 
minimum dietary diversity (MDD), and birth order, could significantly predict the HAZ.

Results. The study identified several significant predictors of height. Specifically, lower HAZ 
was associated with rural living, preterm birth, age 18-23 months, unmarried mothers, anemia, 
lack of MDD, and being third or later born in the family. In contrast, higher HAZ was associated 
with medium or high maternal socioeconomic status and older maternal age.

Conclusions. The study underscores the importance of addressing these significant risk factors 
through distinct interventions to improve height outcomes in at-risk Romanian populations
