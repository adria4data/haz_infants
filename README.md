# haz_infants
 Our objective was to investigate the relationship between infantsâ€™ height and  various demographic parameters, including the mother's location, marital status, socioeconomic  status, age, and infant-specific factors such as being born at term, age, anemia condition, birth  order, and dietary patterns, specifically minimum dietary diversity (MDD).
